Rows of metal doors
Open one!
Those shelves are empty
Imagine dying here
Dusty morgue vibes
No handles inside?!
Who locks them in?
Hearing scratching?
So cold in here
Marco go inside!
$500 to climb in!
This is insane
Stone shelves carved in rock
Claustrophobia intensifies
Anything could be behind those doors
Rats live here now
Don’t close the door!
Keep filming
Something's moving
Dust motes in the flashlight

You can hear how cold it is in there 🧊
Metal on metal echo is making my shoulders tense
That rolling cart sound hits way too hard
Tiles are too clean in a not normal way
Air sounds dense like the mic is muffled by the cold
Every surface in here feels wipeable that is not comforting
The silence is not silent it is humming
That slow hum in the back of the audio is stressing me out
This is industrial quiet not peaceful quiet
Room looks still like nothing in it has moved in forever
I hate that the camera keeps catching reflections
Every tiny noise feels illegal in here
You can smell the disinfectant through the screen
This is not horror movie scary this is real world scary
It is too clean and too empty at the same time
Breathing sounds way louder in this room
You can hear the air system clicking like it is alive
This place is colder than outside somehow
I want to leave and Im not even there
