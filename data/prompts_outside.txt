Night air looks thick bro I can feel the cold through the screen 🌫️
Flashlight is doing all the work here
I swear the wind sounds like whispers
The trees are moving weird or is that just bitrate
Streetlights would be nice right about now
Why is open dark space scarier than inside a building
The ground looks uneven careful
Is that fog or just breath in the light
Everyone shut up I am listening to the background
The sky is way too empty this feels wrong
Steps sound too loud for how slow we are walking
This is classic horror starter zone
You are basically a target out here not even joking
Camera keeps catching random glare I dont like it
Low visibility gaming lets go
Wind keeps peaking the mic I thought it was a growl
Literally one lamp post could fix this whole mood
The silence is aggressive
I got chills and Im not even there
Whole scene just feels watched 👀
