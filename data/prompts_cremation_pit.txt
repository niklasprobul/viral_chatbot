Is that a cremation pit?
Bones in the ash
What was burned here?
That's a giant rat!
Pig or rat?
Who lights candles here?
So many wax stubs
This place is cursed
That mound of dirt
Stop poking it
I smell burning hair
This clearing is disturbing
Someone was here recently
Don’t fall in
Gross
Ash everywhere
Something squealed
Creepy vision

Everything here looks cooked and still warm
Smoke sitting low to the ground is not normal
The air shimmer around that pit is wild
The dirt looks like charcoal instead of dirt
Sparks popping in silence is actually worse than loud fire
That smell must be brutal
Heat haze on camera makes it look like reality is wobbling
Its way too quiet for something that clearly burned recently
You can almost hear the ash moving
Why does the whole place feel like a warning sign
The light bounce off the smoke is sick red
Ground is stained like forever stained
This spot feels like a ritual lobby not a campfire
Breathing here has to feel wrong
Even the air looks heavy like its got weight
Every step kicks up dust that hangs like fog
The pit is giving do not look inside core energy
Low steady crackle noise is freaking me out
This is the definition of bad vibes
