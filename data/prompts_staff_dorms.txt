Old hospital dorms
Beds falling apart
Rotten mattresses
This is gross
Imagine sleeping here
Someone's been smoking?
Sheets shredded
Do they hear scratching?
Those dryers look ancient
Laundry ward vibes

Why do empty bunks feel worse than empty halls
The beds look like someone just stood up and walked out
Overhead lights buzz like angry bees
Lockers in the dark are instant nope
The silence in here is tired not dead
This room smells like stale coffee and panic I can tell
Carpeted floor in horror is cheating it hides footsteps
Random personal stuff left around is way creepier than blood
This feels like they left in a hurry
The still air hits different in old sleeping rooms
Doorways all look the same length apart super liminal
Ceiling tiles look like theyre about to drop
Flicker plus shadows equals someone is standing there vibe every frame
Dorm quiet is not normal quiet its after hours quiet
Theres a humming electronics sound with no electronics on
It feels rude to talk above a whisper here
This space has that no one was supposed to see this energy
You can feel burnout just looking at it
This is not clean this is abandoned
Chat I do not like how lived in this still looks
