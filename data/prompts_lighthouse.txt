Cut the padlock already
That lighthouse looks ancient
Radio gear still there?
Climb to the top for a signal
Check out the antenna
Imagine the view up there!
Someone lived here once
Dusty radio room vibes
This is like Fallout
So vintage
Love the spiral staircase
Those cables though
Looks sturdy
Hope the stairs hold
Cool to see old tech
Don't fall!
The lantern deck is huge
Get a better shot of the coast
That door sign though: Do not enter!
Epic location
