wtf is hanging there?
That bridge is cursed
So many eyes
lul
This is nightmare fuel
Donâ€™t cross that
do a backflip!
Who did this?
Those symbols though.
Burn it all!
Logan Paul moment?
Don't look under the bridge
Bad vibes here
Gross
Feels wrong
Just turn around
Why is the water louder than the wind ðŸ’§
That railing is way too low nope
The whole bridge is shaking or is that just handheld cam
Looking down is instant stomach drop not doing that
You are literally above nothing but dark void
Footsteps sound hollow like cheap metal grating
It feels super exposed out here like nowhere to hide
That drip noise under the bridge is way too rhythmic
I hate how you can hear water but not see water
The middle of the bridge is always the worst spot
Why does the air look colder in the middle
This is full found footage vibes
Street level horror is different it hits real
Fog on the far side looks way thicker than near side
The camera keeps tilting down dont do that
My palms actually sweaty watching this
This is giving last known location energy
Low key expecting something to splash for attention
Cant shake the feeling something is pacing under us
This whole shot is pure nope ðŸŒ‰
