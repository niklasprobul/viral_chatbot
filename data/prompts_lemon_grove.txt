Lemon trees in the dark
What's wrong with those lemons?
Those fruits look mutated
This grove is creepy
Do you smell that?
Buzzing insects everywhere
The lemons are huge!
This is like a horror movie
Don't eat them!
Take a bite lol
Those tendrils
Ugh rotting fruit smell
Leaves look diseased
Citrus cave vibes
Walking on dead leaves
Mist when you step!
So eerie
Sweet and decay at once
These lemons have tumors
Disgusting
Run away from the grove
Why do abandoned fruit trees feel way creepier than a graveyard 🍋
The air looks heavy like sweet and rotten at the same time
Grass is too tall no joke that is snake territory
Every branch in frame looks like a hand reaching
You keep crunching on leaves and it sounds like bones
That smell must be insane right now
I hate how quiet orchards get at night
Camera flash keeps catching little white bits in the dirt bro what is that
The rows all look the same this is maze energy
I swear I heard buzzing but theres no bugs on cam
Trees are bending in the breeze like they are leaning in to listen
Whole scene is nature but it does not feel alive
The color grading is straight sickly yellow
I would not sit on that ground for any amount of money
The fruit on the ground looks wrong
Surrounded on all sides feeling is so strong here
This feels like walking into folklore
Low branches brushing the lens is actually scarier than jump scares
The silence hums here I hate it
I feel infected just watching this
